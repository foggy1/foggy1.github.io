# Fog Blog

My main user page is currently earmarked for DBC use in case we have to do more assignments using that space.  Until then, while I have some spare time on my hands and can afford to procrastinate my Ruby work while it's still easy, I'm messing around with Jekyll and GitHub Pages.

I've used a lot of blogging platforms over the years, and all of them have left me wanting.  To be honest, it's usually just too powerful, and then some of the small stuff becomes too hard to maneuver.  Once I get the hang of markdown, I can type whatever I want.  Throw in a lot of simple, customizable themes, and I'll probably be messing with Jekyll as a blogging platform for awhile.
