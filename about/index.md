I'm Austin Lanari, a full stack web developer looking for new opportunities.  I mostly operate in Ruby and Javascript but I'm more than happy to learn any tool for the job.  You can follow me on [Twitter][twitter], where I tweet about comics more than anything else, check out my [LinkedIn][linkedin], and browse my [Github][github].

My ongoing projects right now are [State Matters][state-matters] and [Eve Postmaster][eve-postmaster].  Please feel free to check them out on Github.

I built this site using Github Pages and Jekyll, helping myself to a Jekyll port, [Kasper][kasper link], of Ghost's default layout, Casper.
