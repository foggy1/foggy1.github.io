I'm Austin.  I've got a Master's in Philosophy and I use the analytic gifts it gave me to write about comic books for several websites and also, sometimes, to ponder the implications of moral and political obligation. Sometimes.

I built this site using Github Pages and Jekyll, helping myself to a Jekyll port, [Kasper][kasper link], of Ghost's default layout, Casper.  I'm currently attending Dev Bootcamp, so what better way to force myself to tinker with front-end stuff than to put my writing someplace that *I* have to maintain?

Wait.  Don't actually tell me if there's a better way.  This is fun.
