	<h1>So Many X-Men, So Little Time</h1>
	
	<p>Herein lies a page dedicated to a few of my favorite X-Men that at <em>least</em> a decade worth of writers and artists have decided to ignore.</p>

	<h2>A (old) New Generation</h2>

	<p>Every couple decades, a new set of students at the Xavier school get introduced.  Many of the new introductions beyond the classic characters with which people are so familiar have not had much staying power, though.  Characters from the iconic <a href="http://marvel.wikia.com/wiki/New_Mutants_(Earth-616)"><cite>New Mutants</cite></a> run of comics that began in the 1980's were beloved, but have had limited to no visibility in the last ten years of <cite>X-Men</cite> Comics.</p>

	<p>Pictured above are <em>their</em> students, the "New X-Men," the first generation of X-Men to be trained at the school without Xavier there to head it up.</p>

	<h3>Unique Powers</h3>
	<p>Some of the abilities featured among these students were unique and, for the most part, never seen again.</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Omega-level healing powers (Elixir)</li>
		<li>The ability to touch someone and force everyone else to flee from that person (Tag)</li>
		<li>Morphing into different metal forms, both liquid and solid (Mercury)</li>
