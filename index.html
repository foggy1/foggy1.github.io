	<h1>So Many X-Men, So Little Time</h1>
	
	<p>Herein lies a page dedicated to a few of my favorite X-Men that at <em>least</em> a decade worth of writers and artists have decided to ignore.</p>

		<h2>A (old) New Generation</h2>

		<p>Every couple decades, a new set of students at the Xavier school get introduced.  Many of the new introductions beyond the classic characters with which people are so familiar have not had much staying power, though.  Characters from the iconic <a href="http://marvel.wikia.com/wiki/New_Mutants_(Earth-616)"><cite>New Mutants</cite></a> run of comics that began in the 1980's were beloved, but have had limited to no visibility in the last ten years of <cite>X-Men</cite> Comics.</p>

		<p>Pictured above are <em>their</em> students, the "New X-Men," the first generation of X-Men to be trained at the school without Xavier there to head it up.</p>

		<h3>Unique Powers</h3>
		<p>Some of the abilities featured among these students were unique and, for the most part, never seen again.</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Omega-level healing powers (Elixir)</li>
			<li>The ability to touch someone and force everyone else to flee from that person (Tag)</li>
			<li>Morphing into different metal forms, both liquid and solid (Mercury)</li>

		<h2>Looking At a Similar Page</h2>
		
		<p>Over at <a href="http://comicsalliance.com/-men-comics-where-to-start/">Comics Alliance</a> they have articles of all sorts, often including articles related to odd X-Men facts or character lists.</p>
		<p>Generally speaking, the only problem I have with the layout of this page is that it lists the most recent articles over on the right.  Given the wide variety of content on the site, it might be more useful to list articles on related topics, going based on the tags of the current article.</p>
		<p>What I like is the centering of the content: the page is easy to read (the text might be a <em>smidge</em> big), the pictures are all under control, and the headings make the article easy to follow.  I also like that the background color isn't overbearing.</p>
		<p>I can follow a lot of the simple code that organizes the page (the presence of footers and a ton of other types of page divisions), but often cannot read the specific formatting being executed because it is being applied via global javascript variables.</p>
		<p>Given the assignment, it's understandable, but one thing the other page does better than mine is that it does not mash together a bunch of different forms of presenting data and stick to text in an essay format.</p>
