But in the time before I jumped ship for a pre-built CMS, I spent the better part of 2017 learning what Gatsby had to offer and I remain impressed and in awe of the framework, both in the benefits it offers from a UI perspective and in how it puts developers in a workflow where they learn a lot of cool, core-front-end skills and end up with great results... once things get working.</p>\n<p>Since my old personal website was a Jekyll blog that I built while I was still at coding bootcamp, I decided to compromise with myself: as long as I continued my blogging about comics at a clip of one essay per week, I could fool around with Gatsby on my personal website.</p>\n<p>But I never told the more practical part of my brain that I'd make it easy.</p>\n<p>If you're reading this when I first posted it, you're on a bare-bones version of Gatsby with all of the boilerplate and... literally no UI tweaks... at all.</p>\n<p>It's going to be a long year.</p>",timeToRead:1,excerpt:"Hey hi, I'm Austin Lanari.
