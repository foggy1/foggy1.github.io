# foggy1.github.io

A work in progress.

Originally (and currently as of the time I'm writing this) this page was built for some basic HTML/CSS work we had to do at Dev Bootcamp.  Once we started moving on to other programming ventures, I decided to use some extra spare time to try and really utilize the functionality (and, you know *free* use) of Githube Pages.

I [write about comics](http://retconrasengan.blogspot.com) both at the linked blog and at several other websites.  Blogger is ok, but not great; I enjoy that it is more stripped down than Wordpress (a single blogger not trying to make a living off of a product or their writing doesn't need the the horsepower of Wordpress, it's just too overwhelming), and Blogger showcases writing better than Tumblr.

The problem is, as far as actually putting the bloggy content stuff *onto* the damn website, Blogger falls short.  It handles content really poorly, and even if you get the template the way you want it, content is content, and depending on the post, Blogger is still a little too big to fiddle with to get things exactly how you want them, even when (and **especially** when) things are simply a matter of alternating text and pictures in a thoughtful way.

So, here's an excuse for me to learn Jekyll, work on my version control skills, work closely with gem packages and an isolated ruby environment, all while honing my HTML and CSS chops.  The end goal is to have a uniquely formatted but attractive and user-friendly place to showcase my comics writing.
